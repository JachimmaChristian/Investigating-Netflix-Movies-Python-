# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-Python-

![](redpopcorn.jpg)

**Objective: To analyze Netflix movie data and determine if movie durations are declining.**

**Methodology:**

Used Python libraries pandas and matplotlib to explore and visualize the data.
Subset the data for movies and analyzed duration by release year and genre.
Created scatter plots to identify trends and patterns.

**Key Insights:**

No clear downward trend in overall movie duration across all release years.
Movie duration varies significantly within and between genres.
Children's movies and documentaries generally have shorter durations compared to action and drama genres.

**Further analysis (statistical tests) is needed to confirm the significance of observed genre-specific patterns.**

Implications:

Storytelling trends might be evolving within specific genres, adapting to audience preferences or platform constraints.
The relationship between movie length and audience engagement in the streaming era requires further investigation.

**Future Work:**

Conduct statistical tests to solidify the significance of genre-specific findings.
Analyze factors beyond runtime, such as storytelling techniques and audience demographics, to understand drivers of movie length variations.
